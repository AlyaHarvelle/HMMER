# Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for disordered protein domains

Author: Skrylnik Alina.

This repository contains the following files: 

- `Data_preparation.ipynb`: extracts the files to work with in MSA and HMM notebooks.
- `MSA.ipynb`: analysis of the multiple sequence alignments.
- `HMM.ipynb`: analysis of the generated Hidden Markov Models.
- `functions.py`: contains the functions used in the previously listed notebooks.

To prepare the files for the following analysis, one needs to start with the `Data_preparation.ipynb`. 
The corresponding analysis is conducted in MSA and HMM notebooks.

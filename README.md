# Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for disordered protein domains

Author: Skrylnik Alina.

This repository contains the following files: 

- `msa_preprocessing.ipynb`, `hmm_preprocessing.ipynb`: extract the files to work with in `msa_analysis` and `hmm_analysis` notebooks.
- `msa_analysis.ipynb`: analysis of the multiple sequence alignments.
- `hmm_analysis.ipynb`: analysis of the generated Hidden Markov Models.
- `functions.py`: contains the functions used in the previously listed notebooks.

To prepare the files for the following analysis, one needs to start with the `msa_preprocessing.ipynb`, then `hmm_preprocessing.ipynb`. 
The corresponding analysis is conducted in `msa_analysis.ipynb` and `hmm_analysis.ipynb`.
